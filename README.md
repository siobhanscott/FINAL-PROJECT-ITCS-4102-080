# **Trends In Modern Programming**
>The modern programming environment have been rapidly evolving with new languages, methodologies, and evolving technologies. 
Some of the main new trends in modern programming are low-code vs no-code development,
AI and machine learning, declarative programming, new emerging languages, and many other topics. We will explore these trends as well as give examples of new languages.

### **Low Code vs. No Code**
Low-code and no-code programming platforms are new emerging ways to simplify the coding process and accelerate the application process.
Low coding allows users with minimal coding experience to create different applications through user interfaces, APIs, 
and different coding templates. Some examples of low-code platforms are Zoho Creator used for databases, Airplane, and Appian. 
Low coding with professional developers has been mentioned to have a quick turnout when delivering applications. 
When it comes to cost, low coding is a benefit for companies trying to save money instead of hiring experienced coders who come at a premium.
Low coding platforms are consistent, easy to use, and are on the rise to the new programming environment.  

 

No-code programming allows users with no coding experience at all to create advanced applications like building software, websites, or databases. 
Similar to low-coding, no-code platforms utilize built-in tools to help the user. Some examples of no-code platforms are Bubble, Webflow, and Airtable which can be used for creating web 
and mobile apps, interactive websites, or creating collaborative spaces. 

 

The choice on choosing between low-code or no-code platforms depends on the complexity of the project as well as the skill level of the user. 
Low and no-coding applications have also been integrated into AI and machine learning. Some examples are Apple Create ML, DataRobot, PyCaret, or Amazon SageMaker. 

### **Machine Learning and AI**
The evolving integration of machine learning and AI applications into programming environments has been rapid and increasing over the years. 
These tools and methods of using pre-trained applications can help with developing code, bug detections, and other different data-driven automation. 
The most common languages involved with machine learning and AI are Python, Shell, Java/JavaScript, C++, etc. To achieve machine learning, your coding system has to access 
different libraries like TensorFlow for Python or JavaScript, JavaML for Java, Caffe for C++, and other different built-in libraries.
