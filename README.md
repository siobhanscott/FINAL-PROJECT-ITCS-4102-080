# **Trends In Modern Programming**
>The modern programming environment have been rapidly evolving with new languages, methodologies, and evolving technologies. 
Some of the main new trends in modern programming are low-code vs no-code development,
AI and machine learning, declarative programming, new emerging languages, and many other topics. We will explore these trends as well as give examples of new languages.

## **Low Code vs. No Code**
Low-code and no-code programming platforms are new emerging ways to simplify the coding process and accelerate the application process.
Low coding allows users with minimal coding experience to create different applications through user interfaces, APIs, 
and different coding templates. Some examples of low-code platforms are Zoho Creator used for databases, Airplane, and Appian. 
Low coding with professional developers has been mentioned to have a quick turnout when delivering applications. 
When it comes to cost, low coding is a benefit for companies trying to save money instead of hiring experienced coders who come at a premium.
Low coding platforms are consistent, easy to use, and are on the rise to the new programming environment.  

 

No-code programming allows users with no coding experience at all to create advanced applications like building software, websites, or databases. 
Similar to low-coding, no-code platforms utilize built-in tools to help the user. Some examples of no-code platforms are Bubble, Webflow, and Airtable which can be used for creating web 
and mobile apps, interactive websites, or creating collaborative spaces. 

 

The choice on choosing between low-code or no-code platforms depends on the complexity of the project as well as the skill level of the user. 
Low and no-coding applications have also been integrated into AI and machine learning. Some examples are Apple Create ML, DataRobot, PyCaret, or Amazon SageMaker. 

## **Machine Learning and AI**
The evolving integration of machine learning and AI applications into programming environments has been rapid and increasing over the years. 
These tools and methods of using pre-trained applications can help with developing code, bug detections, and other different data-driven automation. 
The most common languages involved with machine learning and AI are Python, Shell, Java/JavaScript, C++, etc. To achieve machine learning, your coding system has to access 
different libraries like TensorFlow for Python or JavaScript, JavaML for Java, Caffe for C++, and other different built-in libraries.

>This provided code is an example of how you can use Python and TensorFlow to train a model using data.
1. <code style="code : code">In the first section, we import our TensorFlow library, our Keras API, and NumPy library for numerical evaluations. </code>
2. <code style="code : code">The next section will create a neural network model. It creates a linear stack of layers, with the first and second layers both having 10 units each.</code>
3. <code style="code : code">The “model.compile” section is for configuring the model to train and adding functions to measure the accuracy. </code>
4. <code style="code : code">In the data and labels section, this will generate an array with random numbers to represent samples.</code>
5. <code style="code : code">In the last line, this will train the model on the specific data and release an output describing the loss, accuracy, and other test evaluations.  
 </code>

 ## Popular Programming Languages
 Different programming languages can offer coders a variety of features for different applications.
 In this section, we will cover Python, SQL, Java, HTML, and new emerging languages like Kotlin and Rust.  

 ### Python
 Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is still one of the top-used programming languages because of its simplicity and use for a wide range of functions. 
 It can be used for web development, machine learning, mathematics, or even data science. Here is an example of some Python code developed in Visual Studio Code:

> In this program, we have created a simple advanced Python program that integrates OOP concepts with a banking program. <code style="code : code"> 
 1. We have the bank account class and constructor, as well as deposit and withdrawal methods.
 2. This program also includes user input and a choice table for the user to conduct different transactions.
 3. It will prompt the user for a name and account balance, afterwards a menu will be provided to do different transactions.
4. The following screenshot is a mock example of how the program should run: </code>

### Structured Query Language (SQL)
Next, we will cover the SQL programming language, also known as structured query language. This language is most known for managing databases. 
You can perform tasks such as queries on provided data, updating data, and managing the database structures. 
SQL can play an important role in data management and application development, because of its data retrieval and data storage capabilities. 
Here is an example of SQL developed in MySQL WorkBench: 

<code style="code : code">This is a mock hospital database. The goal of this application is to create a functioning hospital database including tables to represent required information, 
inputted data, and examples of queries you can perform.</code>

> The Hospital Schema is the foundational file.This file creates the hospital database, as well as creating 9 tables for the inputted data.
