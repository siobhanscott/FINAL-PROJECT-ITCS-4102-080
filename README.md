# **Trends In Modern Programming**
>The modern programming environment have been rapidly evolving with new languages, methodologies, and evolving technologies. 
Some of the main new trends in modern programming are low-code vs no-code development,
AI and machine learning, declarative programming, new emerging languages, and many other topics. We will explore these trends as well as give examples of new languages.

## **Low Code vs. No Code**
Low-code and no-code programming platforms are new emerging ways to simplify the coding process and accelerate the application process.
Low coding allows users with minimal coding experience to create different applications through user interfaces, APIs, 
and different coding templates. Some examples of low-code platforms are Zoho Creator used for databases, Airplane, and Appian. 
Low coding with professional developers has been mentioned to have a quick turnout when delivering applications. 
When it comes to cost, low coding is a benefit for companies trying to save money instead of hiring experienced coders who come at a premium.
Low coding platforms are consistent, easy to use, and are on the rise to the new programming environment.  

 

No-code programming allows users with no coding experience at all to create advanced applications like building software, websites, or databases. 
Similar to low-coding, no-code platforms utilize built-in tools to help the user. Some examples of no-code platforms are Bubble, Webflow, and Airtable which can be used for creating web 
and mobile apps, interactive websites, or creating collaborative spaces. 

 

The choice on choosing between low-code or no-code platforms depends on the complexity of the project as well as the skill level of the user. 
Low and no-coding applications have also been integrated into AI and machine learning. Some examples are Apple Create ML, DataRobot, PyCaret, or Amazon SageMaker. 

## **Machine Learning and AI**
The evolving integration of machine learning and AI applications into programming environments has been rapid and increasing over the years. 
These tools and methods of using pre-trained applications can help with developing code, bug detections, and other different data-driven automation. 
The most common languages involved with machine learning and AI are Python, Shell, Java/JavaScript, C++, etc. To achieve machine learning, your coding system has to access 
different libraries like TensorFlow for Python or JavaScript, JavaML for Java, Caffe for C++, and other different built-in libraries.

5. <code style="code : code">In the last line, this will train the model on the specific data and release an output describing the loss, accuracy, and other test evaluations.  
 </code>

 ## Popular Programming Languages
 Different programming languages can offer coders a variety of features for different applications.
 In this section, we will cover Python, SQL, Java, HTML, and new emerging languages like Kotlin and Rust.  

 ### Python
 Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is still one of the top-used programming languages because of its simplicity and use for a wide range of functions. 
 It can be used for web development, machine learning, mathematics, or even data science. Here is an example of some Python code developed in Visual Studio Code:

### Structured Query Language (SQL)
Next, we will cover the SQL programming language, also known as structured query language. This language is most known for managing databases. 
You can perform tasks such as queries on provided data, updating data, and managing the database structures. 
SQL can play an important role in data management and application development, because of its data retrieval and data storage capabilities. 
Here is an example of SQL developed in MySQL WorkBench: 

<code style="code : code">This is a mock hospital database. The goal of this application is to create a functioning hospital database including tables to represent required information, 
inputted data, and examples of queries you can perform.</code>

> The Hospital Queries file showcases how you can manipulate the system to find specific types of data within the database.
You can use the program to figure out what nurses or doctors are assigned to which patient, medical bills, doctors' notes, or a combination of information. 

### JAVA
The programming language Java has always been a reliable and popular language among coders. It is mostly used for development applications or large-scale projects. It is a high-level object-oriented language that is platform-independent.  Here is an example of a Java project developed in Apache NetBeans:  

 
This is a Hotel program that uses Java to showcase the management side of a hotel. It calculates and displays the total number of rooms, occupied rooms, vacant rooms, occupancy rate, and total hotel revenue based on user input.

> This is a simple factorial Kotlin code developed in Visual Studio Codes.
> 1. We declare and initialize the number 5 and call the factorial function.
> 2. We then print the results.

### RUST
This is a modern programming language that has an emphasis on performance, safety, and concurrency. Rust was initially designed to address issues faced by lower-level software systems. 
The following is an example of Rust code, developed in Visual Studio Code:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c1900a-7ad1-4be6-bf84-182c77af8225)


> This program, will create a system that takes numbers from an array, and find the sum, the maximum number, and then doubles each element in the array. We first start by defining an array of integers. We then create a for loop to go through each element in the array. In the next section, we calculate the sum of all of the elements in the array, and after we find the max element in the array. In the last function, we create a new array from the original that will double all the numbers.


### Imperative and Declarative Programming 
Imperative programming is the original and basic coding approach that focuses on how the
 program runs given explicit information. Examples of imperative programming languages are
 Java, Python, Ruby, and Pascal. Declarative programming is the opposite and focuses on what
 the program should accomplish instead of how to achieve it. A prime example of declarative
 programming languages would be SQL, along with Prolog or Lisp. Also, different makeup
 languages like HTML would be considered declarative.
 Here are two examples and an analysis
 of imperative and declarative programming, developed in Visual Studio Code:
 
<code style="code : code">Imperative (Ruby):</code>

 >The following code was created with the language Ruby and developed in
 Visual Studio Code. This program has a parent class called Animal and two child classes called
 Dog and Cat. The goal of the program is to call on the speak method for both animals so that the
 dog says woof or the cat says meow.


<code style="code : code">Declarative(SQL):</code>
